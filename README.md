This project demonstrates the process of creating and analyzing a database for an employee system. The challenge is 
divided into three parts. 1. Modeling- Designing an ERD and defining the database schema. 2. Engineering- Creating and
populating the database tables from CSV files. 3. Analysis- Writing SQL queries to analyze the data to answer 
specific questions. I first created the ERD on quickdatabasediagrams.com. The DBD export file has the code to set
up the tables and their relationships. I next imported the data from the CSV files in the Starter Code file to populate
the respective tables. Last all of the quries can be found in the queries.sql file. The csv files with the output from 
the quries are also available in the employeesql file.
